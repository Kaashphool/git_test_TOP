This repository contains my first Web Designing project that I developed by myself during my training with The Odin Project.
I hope you find my project well designed. Also, try out some of the recipes listed in the website. They may be able to create a symphony in your mouth!

If you want to get int touch for collaborating on a project or if you have an opening at your firm, hit me up at kaash2500@gmail.com.
Thanks for visiitng my website!
